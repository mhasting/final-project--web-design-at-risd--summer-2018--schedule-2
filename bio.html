My dog Benji died in 2001. I was seven and it devastated me.
The same year, a movie called Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase
came out, the War on Terror began, and the Fiber-Optic Link
Around the Globe was put into operation in the US. It was
the year of the Space Odyssey and the longest strike in NYC’s
history, the year my brother and I got our first computer.

 Using all the words I had learned in my then-short life, I
began to write a dystopia story on my computer. It came out
just as one might expect: a shoddy retelling of the Matrix
sequel, the plot of which had been recounted to me by my
father’s friend earlier that year. What I thought I was
writing was a story of survival, of repair, of keys and
codes that fell apart in your hands but if fixed the right
way could open doors into new dimensions.

Today, my work tries to live up to the story I believed I
was writing. It was and is a fucked up world with confused
rules, and I do my best to make sense of it using ritualistic
action and round-about logic. Working predominantly with
custom electronics, video, and poetry, the work is instru-
mentalized in my search for the matrix as my nine year old
self once imagined- liberated, exploding, and closer than
one might think.
